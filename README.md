# Stopwatch App

This Stopwatch App is a web application that tracks time with millisecond accuracy. The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a client-side architecture that uses the Date object to track elapsed time. The app includes a formatTime() function that formats the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. Event listeners update the timer display and laps list in real-time.

To run the Stopwatch App, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. No additional installation or prerequisites are required.

Thank you for using my Stopwatch App!
